## About me

![DD796710-973F-44DF-98E0-099D239DAB9C](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116759119/205980476-6a22e0ba-43ec-4b4e-b4b8-f93ec7dee14b.JPG)

Here is something about me. 

Love to learn, love to work in a multicultural environment. World-curious personality,
open-minded, reliable, and flexible in writing about many different topics. Familiarized with
remote work, independent, well-organized, and paying attention to details. Perfectionist at
work, friendly and helpful as a teammate. Nothing is a failure - it is rather an opportunity to
gain experience and improve skills. During getting tasks done, I find the sound of a washing
machine relaxing.
